## Switch Exercise

# Instructions

Create a program that takes a number (`Int`) as an input and prints the corresponding day of the week using a `switch` statement.

e.g. If the input was `5`

Then the function should print:

"Friday"

If the input number does not match a day of the week then your program should print "Error".

The weekday printed needs to have the first letter capitalised and spelt correctly.
